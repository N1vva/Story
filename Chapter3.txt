Most of the methods we use in Express are asynchronous?you specify an operation to perform, passing a callback. The method returns immediately, and the callback is invoked when the requested operation completes. By convention in Express, callback functions pass an error value as the first parameter (or null on success) and the results from the function (if there are any) as the second parameter.
